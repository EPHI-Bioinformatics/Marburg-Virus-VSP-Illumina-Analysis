# 🧬 MARV-Gen: Marburg Virus VSP Illumina Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a reproducible analysis pipeline for processing Illumina sequencing data of Marburg virus (MARV) samples. The workflow includes raw data quality control, host read depletion, viral mapping, BAM QC, variant calling, consensus sequence generation, coverage assessment, Nextclade analysis, phylogenetics, and MultiQC reporting. The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and features intelligent environment management.

## Overview

This pipeline automates the analysis of Illumina sequencing reads for Marburg virus. It is optimized for:

- High-throughput batch processing
- Flexible use of computational resources (multi-threaded)
- Comprehensive logging for reproducibility
- Integration with downstream analysis (phylogenetics, consensus sequences, coverage statistics)

## Pipeline Steps

The workflow is organized into the following steps, each implemented as a batch script:

| Step | Script                      | Description                                                                                               |
| ---- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `copy_marv_fasta.sh`        | Filters downloaded Marburg virus genomes ≥18,000 bp and prepares reference files.                         |
| 2    | `fastp_batch.sh`            | Quality trimming, adapter removal, and filtering of raw FASTQ reads.                                      |
| 3    | `host_removal_batch.sh`     | Removes host reads to retain viral sequences.                                                             |
| 4    | `mapping_batch.sh`          | Maps reads to the Marburg reference genome using Minimap2.                                                |
| 5    | `qualimap_batch.sh`         | Performs BAM QC using Qualimap on mapped BAM files.                                                       |
| 6    | `variant_calling_batch.sh`  | Calls variants using samtools mpileup and iVar.                                                           |
| 7    | `consensus_batch.sh`        | Generates consensus sequences from BAM files using iVar.                                                  |
| 8    | `coverage_batch.sh`         | Computes per-base coverage, genome coverage, and ambiguous bases.                                         |
| 9    | `multiqc_batch.sh`          | Aggregates QC reports from Fastp and Qualimap, producing fastp, qualimap, and combined reports.           |
| 10   | `msa_batch.sh`              | Combines reference and consensus sequences, aligns with MAFFT, trims with trimAl, generates CSV metadata. |
| 11   | `iqtree_batch.sh`           | Builds phylogenetic trees from MSA using IQ-TREE, restores original leaf names, and creates summary.      |
| 12   | `run_marg_full_pipeline.sh` | Launches the entire workflow in sequence, handling intermediate directories and logging.                  |

 Note: Steps 10 and 11 (msa_batch.sh and iqtree_batch.sh) are not included in the automated full pipeline; they should be run separately after step 9 if phylogenetic analysis is needed.

The pipeline uses the following software tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
- [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) – Quality control of FASTQ reads
- [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) – Host read removal
- [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) – BAM/SAM manipulation
- [iVar](https://andersen-lab.github.io/ivar/html/) – Variant calling and consensus generation
- [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) – Read mapping
- [Qualimap](http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es) – BAM QC

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EPHI-Bioinformatics/Marburg-Virus-VSP-Illumina-Analysis.git
cd Marburg-Virus-VSP-Illumina-Analysis
```

```bash
conda create -n fastp_env -c bioconda -y fastp
```
 2. Host Read Removal (Bowtie2)

```


3. Prepare input directories:
```bash
raw_reads/                  # Raw FASTQ files
reference_genomes/MARV_downloads/   # Downloaded MARV genomes
reference_genomes/MARV_compare/     # Filtered reference genomes from downloaded MARV genomes
```

## Usage
1. Place raw FASTQ files in a designated directory (e.g., raw_reads/).
2. Prepare the reference genome in reference_genomes/Marburg_reference.fasta.
3. Run the full pipeline:
```bash
bash scripts/run_marg_full_pipeline.sh
```
4. Alternatively, run individual steps as needed:
```bash
bash scripts/fastp_batch.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/host_removal_batch.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/mapping_batch.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/qualimap_batch.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/variant_calling_batch.sh
```
```bash
bash scripts/consensus_batch.sh

## Logging
Each script writes per-sample logs in logs/.
A summary table is generated for mapping, variant calling, consensus, and coverage statistics.
Logs capture runtime, errors, and pipeline decisions.
